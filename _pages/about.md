**Hello!**

<span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold;">I am actively looking for a post-doctoral research position involving computational mechanics and/or physics informed deep learning.</span> I am eager to learn, contribute, and grow within the high-performance computing community, particularly regarding their role in computational mechanics and deep learning to assist in solving complex engineering problems.

I am currently working as an overseas postdoctoral consultant at City, University of London, focusing on the design of twin-screw compressor rotor profiles using generative deep learning. In this project, we are able to generate physically valid rotor profiles and this work is expected to be completed by the end of August 2024. During my PhD, I developed computationally efficient tools for generating rich datasets of composite material microstructures and their homogenization, utilizing Julia and Python extensively. I also developed CNN-based surrogate models to predict the multi-physical properties of material systems and fiber volume fractions over practical ranges.
