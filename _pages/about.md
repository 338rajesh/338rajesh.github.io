**Hello!**

Thanks for visiting my homepage.

<br>

<span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold;">I am actively looking for research and development roles in industry and research labs, involving computational mechanics and/or deep learning.</span>
My research interests focus primarily on computational solid mechanics with a strong passion for coding. 
Also, I am interested in using the deep learning models as supporting tools for enhancing the reliability, computational efficiency of methods used in solving complex engineering problems. 

I am currently working as an overseas consultant at City, University of London, focusing on the design of twin-screw compressor rotor profiles using generative deep learning. In this project, we are able to generate physically valid rotor profiles of the [Demonstrator class](https://www.staff.city.ac.uk/~ra601/xian11.pdf), with the performance as good as the benchmark profiles of the respective profiles category. During my PhD, I developed computationally efficient tools for generating rich datasets of composite material microstructures and their homogenization, utilizing [Julia](https://julialang.org/), [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [gmsh](https://gmsh.info/) extensively. I also developed CNN-based surrogate models to predict the multi-physical properties of material systems and fiber volume fractions spanning over end-to-end practical ranges using a simple and novel material property encoding scheme.

**My Philosophy Towards Computational Mechanics and Coding**

+ I believe that mathematics is a indispensable tool for effective contributions in mechanics and deep learning. I want to contribute, learn and grow through application of mathematics. 
+ I like to work on problems that are as generic as possible so that a whole class of problems can be addressed simultaneously.
+ I enjoy writing lightweight code using a plug-and-play modular approach, making it transferable and extendable. I appreciate the importance of clear and concise documentation in easier and effective collaboration.
+ As a hobby, I enjoy building tools that replace everyday repetitive tasks. See, for example, [CLI with GUI](https://github.com/338rajesh/clip), [NumPy Inspector](https://github.com/338rajesh/npi), [Code-snippets](https://github.com/338rajesh/my-code-snippets)
+ I appreciate the crucial role of parallel and high performance computing. As a system administrator of Rocks cluster during my PhD, I gained working experience in high-performance computing, and I am very keen to learn new things in this direction.
