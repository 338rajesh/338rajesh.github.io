**Hello!**

Thanks for visiting my homepage.

**I am actively looking for industrial R\&D engineering, involving computational mechanics and coding. Please find my latest [CV Here](/cv.pdf)** 

I hold a PhD with expertise in computational mechanics, software development and deep learning. Skilled in Finite Element Analysis (FEA), Python, Julia, Git, and HPC parallel computing, with a strong focus on applying academic research to practical industrial R \& D solutions. Ready to leverage academic rigour and innovative thinking in a dynamic industrial research environment.


*My Philosophy Towards Computational Mechanics and Coding*

+ I believe that mathematics is a indispensable tool for making effective contributions in mechanics. I want to contribute, learn and grow through application of mathematics. 
+ I like to work on problems that are as generic as possible so that a whole class of problems can be addressed simultaneously.
+ I enjoy writing lightweight code using a plug-and-play modular approach, making it transferable and extendable. I appreciate the importance of clear and concise documentation in easier and effective collaboration.
+ As a hobby, I enjoy building tools that replace everyday repetitive tasks. See, for example, [CLI with GUI](https://github.com/338rajesh/clip), [NumPy Inspector](https://github.com/338rajesh/npi), [Code-snippets](https://github.com/338rajesh/my-code-snippets)
+ I appreciate the crucial role of parallel and high performance computing. As a system administrator of Rocks cluster during my PhD, I gained working experience in high-performance computing, and I am very keen to further my knowledge in this direction.
