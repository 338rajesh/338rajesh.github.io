**Hello!**

 I am in the concluding stage of PhD (thesis under review) at Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru, India. I enjoy working with mechanics and its computational aspects.
 
 
 At present, I am working on a short project (developing twin-screw compressor profiles using generative AI) at City, University of London, which is expected to be completed by Dec'23.
<span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold;">I am actively looking for a post-doctoral research position involving computational mechanics.</span> Please check my latest [<span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold;">CV</span>](/assets/pdf/resume_26102023.pdf), as on 26-Oct-2023  (2 pages).
