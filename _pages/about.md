**Hello!**

 I am in the concluding stage of PhD (thesis under review) at Indian Institute of Science, Banagalore, India. At present, I am working on a short project (developing twin-screw compressor profiles using generative AI) with City, University of London, which is expected to be completed by Dec'23. 
 I am **actively looking for a post-doctoral research position in computational mechanics field**.

<br/><br/>
In my PhD thesis, titled<br/> 
"**Prediction of multi-physical properties of fibre-reinforced composites using deep learning**", 

+ I have <ins>*developed an universal-overlap detection and removal scheme*</ins> between arbitray shapes is developed, as a part of generating RVEs with arbitrary inclusion shapes. In this part of work, I have learnt and used used geometry skills, in addition to the statistical analysis and micro-mechanical aspects.

+ I have <ins>*developed a computationally efficient in-house homogenisation tool for multi-physical properties evaluation*</ins>, in Julia language, using Variational Asymptotic Method and FEA based homogenisation tool along with my fellow PhD student A. Phaneendra.

+ I have *<ins>studied the influence of fibre cross-sectional profile on multi-physical properties</ins>* (thermal, mechanical and piezo-electrical) of uni-directional composite materials, utilising the in-house homogenisation tool. 

+ I have *<ins>developed a generalised surrogate deep learning CNN model</ins>* for predicting thermal and thermo-mechanical properties of fibre reinforced composites, with *fibre volume fractions and material systems spanning end-to-end practical range*.
