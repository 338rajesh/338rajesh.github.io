Hello! I am in the concluding stage of PhD program at Indian Institute of Science, Banagalore, India. I am actively **looking for post-doctoral research position** in mechanics related fields. I enjoy coding and solving problems.

*In my PhD thesis*, 
+ A method for universal-overlap detection and removal between arbitray shapes is developed
+ Influence of fibre cross-sectional profile on multi-physical properties is studied
+ A generalised surrogate deep learning model based is developed for predicting elastic properties of fibre reinforced composites, with fibre volume fractions and material systems spanning end-to-end practical range.

### **Research Interests**

* Micromechanics
* Scientific Machine Learning
* Geometry

### **Education**

* 2018 - 2023 **Ph.D, Aerospace Structures, Indian Institute of Science**.
  <!-- * multi-physical properties prediction of fibre-reinforced composites using deep learning -->
* 2012-2014 **M.Tech. in Machine Design, IIT Bombay** .
* 2008-2012 **B.Tech. in Mechanical Engineering, JNTUH College of Engineering-Hyderabad**.

### **Employment**

* 2015-2017 **Assistant Professor** at Bapatla Engineering College, India
* 2014-2015 **Post Graduate Engineer Trainee** at Mahindra Research Valley, Mahindra & Mahindra, Chennai, India.
